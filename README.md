# Project Description:

The project aims to develop a software for managing a chain store for selling plants. The software has different types of users: Main Admin, Shop Admin, different workers and different types of clients. Each one of the users has his own role in managing the chain store.

The software uses TCP/IP protoccol to connect clients to the user and is supposed to run clients on the same LAN as the server side. We let many clients connect at the same time to the server without any problem.
